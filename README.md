## Evolving Digital Certificates Project from MIT Media Lab

 > "When certification systems are not working well, the consequences can be more than just inefficient, such as the cumbersome and expensive process of requesting a university transcript: they can be disastrous, such as when a refugee is unable to provide a certificate of completed study, and is therefore prevented from continuing her education. Digital systems could help in both of these situations." - **MIT Media Lab**

**Working Example** : http://certificates-bootcamp.mit.edu/57bc6063a1c0dc00096a0f0b _(A sample cert from MIT's Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp 2016)_

_Note : Websites like https://coins.media.mit.edu/ and https://hr.learningmachine.com/* certs are moved._
